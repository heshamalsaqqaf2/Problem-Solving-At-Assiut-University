              Given two numbers A and B. Print the greatest common divisor between (A, B).
                    Note: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more integers, which are not all zeroes,
                        is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers.
                    For example:
                        the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.
                        because the numbers that divides both 8 and 12 are (1,2,4) and 4 is the largest one.
              Input : Only one line containing two numbers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 10 ).
              Output : Print the GCD of A and B.
              Example:
                - standard input => standard output
                    12 8 => 4
                    3 7 => 1
                    5 10 => 5
              //! Note:
                What is the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24?
                    -The number 54 can be expressed as a product of two integers in several deferent ways:
                        54 * 1 = 27 * 2 = 18 * 3 = 9 * 6 .....
                    - Thus the divisors of 54  are: 1,2,3,6,9,18,27,54
                    - Similarly, the divisors of 24 are: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24
                    - The numbers that these two lists share in common are the common divisors of 54 and 24: 1,2,3,6
                    - The greatest of these is 6. That is, the greatest common divisor of 54 and 24.
                    - One writes: gcd(54,24) = 6.
